Boardgame recommendation program


Description:

The program will recommend a boardgame to play matching the user input with an existing boardgame collection.
To do this the program collects user input on the following criteria:
* number of players
* age of youngest player
* time the game should approximately take to play
* type of boardgame the user wants to play

In order to narrow down the boardgame types for the user, they can make use of an autocomplete feature and simply type the first (few) characters of the category to see all the options displayed that start with these letters.
They will then be able to select the category by typing the number displayed next to it.

After collecting all the input the program filters the boardgame collection against these criteria and displays the results.
Finally, the user has the option to repeat the process if they are not happy with the results.

About:
This is the final project for the "Data Structures and Algorithms" course on codecademy.com, created by Peafly_78.
The aim of the project was to store the data in a data structure of our choice - a linkedlist in this case - write the recommendation functionality and implement an autocomplete feature.
